# Clarinet Testing for PoX 

*DISCLAIMER*: because in this repo we are testing a standalone version of PoX some functionality might be missing or limit. For example the locked/unlocked balance of STX is not updated by the standalone PoX contract because these balances are updated by the blockchain node and stored outside of the PoX smart contract.

`ok | 17 passed | 0 failed (1s)`


## Run

```sh
clarinet test             # Run tests
clarinet test --coverage  # Run tests and generate coverage.lcov file
```

## Notes

- `pox-mainnet.clar` constants are hardcoded in to `pox-3.clar`.
- `The build-in function `stx-account` doesn't work in this test environment
  - A drop-in replacement function, `stx-account-from-pox3-data`, is hardcoded into `pox-3.clar`
  - Instances of `stx-account` have been commented out from `pox-3.clar` and replaced with this function
  - This function may not work in all cases. In particular, `unlock-height` is probably not correct
